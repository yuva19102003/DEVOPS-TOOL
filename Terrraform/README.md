### Introduction

Welcome to the Terraform Overview! This document provides a high-level overview of Terraform, a powerful Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. Terraform enables users to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language.

### What is Terraform?

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision infrastructure in a safe, efficient, and repeatable manner. Terraform uses a declarative configuration language to describe the desired state of infrastructure, and it automates the process of creating and managing resources across various cloud providers, on-premises environments, and other infrastructure platforms.

### Key Features

  -Declarative Configuration: Infrastructure is defined using a human-readable configuration language, making it easy to understand and maintain.
  -Multi-Cloud Support: Terraform supports a wide range of cloud providers, enabling users to manage resources across multiple environments seamlessly.
  -Resource Graph: Terraform builds a dependency graph of resources to determine the optimal order for provisioning and managing infrastructure.
  -Idempotent Operations: Terraform ensures that the desired infrastructure state is achieved, making it safe to apply configurations repeatedly without causing unintended changes.
  -Extensibility: Users can extend Terraform's functionality through providers, modules, and custom scripts.
