Success! Added /home/yuva/.local/bin to the PATH environment variable.

Consider adding shell completions for pipx. Run 'pipx completions' for instructions.

You will need to open a new terminal or re-login for the PATH changes to take effect. Alternatively, you can source your shell's config file with e.g.
'source ~/.bashrc'.

Otherwise pipx is ready to go! ✨ 🌟 ✨
